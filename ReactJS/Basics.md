After Node.js is successfully installed on your system, type the following command in your Command Prompt:

## npm i -g create-react-app

Here, npm stands for Node Package Manager, which gets installed while installing Node.js. Moreover, i stands for install, which is a command. You can also write install in place of i.

g stands for global and is preceded with a hyphen because it is a flag.

create-react-app is the name of the package that you need to install. It is a CLI tool that allows you to quickly create and run React applications, with no configuration required from the user's side.

This command will make npm install create-react-app package globally on your machine so that you can create a React application at any valid path on your system.
