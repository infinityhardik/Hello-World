/* 
WAY 1:

Define a then() method with only TWO arguments â€“ first as the successCallbackHandler and the second as the errorCallbackHandler.
NO need to define the catch() method.

The then() method will be used to handle both - the success as well as the error(s).



.then(successCallback, errorCallback)


WAY 2:

Define a then() method with only ONE argument as the successCallbackHandler.
DEFINE a catch() method with one argument as errorCallbackHandler.

The then() method will handle the success whereas the catch() method will handle the error(s).


.then(successCallback)
.catch(errorCallback)
