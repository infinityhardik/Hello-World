# Initialize

- `npm init`

  > This initialises the Node Package Manager and creates File Dependencies using package.json.

- `npm i express`
  > To Install Express.js

## Production Dependency and Development Dependency

> Production Dependency will mean the Package will be required for Final Production Build.

> If some packages or dependency are in Development Dependency, then they don't bundle up with the Final Production Build and they will be required only when the development takes place.

> Example : Nodemon will be required only when we are undertaking development and not in the Final Build.

**Everything is Exported as a Module in Node just like a Component in React**
