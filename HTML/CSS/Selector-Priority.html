<!-- The background color will be red and the text color will be yellow. 
    This is because the id selector gets the highest priority. 
    Here, id has a red background color and thus, the text will take up red as the background-color. 
    Also, the class has higher priority than tag selector and, hence, the text color will become yellow.
    
    The order of priority of selectors is as follows: id selector > class selector > tag selector.
